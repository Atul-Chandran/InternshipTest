# Pre-Requisites

Ensure the following are installed before running this application:-

1) Node JS ( Refer:- https://nodejs.org/en/download/ )
2) React JS ( Refer:- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

# Getting Started

1) The data is fetched from "mongodb://localhost:27017/" in my local setup of mongodb, so ensure you have a collection of the data too. Import the dataset from csvjson.json in directory "NodeJS".

2) Navigate to "NodeJS" directory in terminal and type "node app.js", ensure the application is running by exporting "Backend.postman_collection" in postman and running an API route.

3) Once the API is running nice and fine, navigate to "ReactJS" directory in terminal and type "npm install" and execute, this will install all the packages set up in package.json.

4) Now, type "npm start" and execute the command. The application will ideally open in browser of URL http://localhost:3000/, if not, type this URL in the browser and the stock application must be up and running.
